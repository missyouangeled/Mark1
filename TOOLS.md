# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras

- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS

- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Local Setup Notes

### OpenClaw automation

- Startup online notice is driven by `BOOT.md` + the `boot-md` hook.
- Resume recovery watcher script: `scripts/openclaw-resume-watch.sh`
- User systemd units:
  - `~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-resume-watch.service`
  - `~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-resume-watch.timer`

### Git / GitHub

- This machine has a GitHub-specific SSH key at `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github_openclaw`.
- If plain `git push origin master` hits `Permission denied (publickey)`, use:
  - `GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github_openclaw -o IdentitiesOnly=yes' git push origin master`
- Cause: the default SSH identity selection may miss the GitHub key unless it is specified explicitly or wired through `~/.ssh/config`.

### CLI-Anything

- Local repository path: `/home/missyouangeled/Desktop/CLI-Anything`
- OpenClaw skill installed at: `~/.openclaw/skills/cli-anything/SKILL.md`
- Local helper command installed at: `~/.local/bin/cli-anything`
  - `cli-anything repo` → print repo path
  - `cli-anything skill` → print installed OpenClaw skill path
  - `cli-anything openclaw` → print suggested OpenClaw usage
- Important: CLI-Anything itself is not a single preinstalled global official executable on this machine. It is mainly a repo containing an OpenClaw skill, Claude Code plugin, OpenCode commands, and generated per-software harnesses.
- Minimal local verification succeeded with the built-in GIMP harness via:
  - `PYTHONPATH=/home/missyouangeled/Desktop/CLI-Anything/gimp/agent-harness python3 -m cli_anything.gimp.gimp_cli --help`
  - `PYTHONPATH=/home/missyouangeled/Desktop/CLI-Anything/gimp/agent-harness python3 -m cli_anything.gimp.gimp_cli project profiles`
- Note: the sample GIMP harness README still references an older module path (`python3 -m cli.gimp_cli`), but the runnable module on this machine is `python3 -m cli_anything.gimp.gimp_cli`.

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
